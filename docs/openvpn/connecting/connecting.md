## How do I get Started?
We have a [**room dedicated to helping**](https://tryhackme.com/room/openvpn) you install the lightweight software that is needed to connect you to our network. The room visualises the install process for the operating system of your choice!

However, if you're familiar with OpenVPN, we recommend [**visiting this page**](https://tryhackme.com/connect) which outlines the same process in a concise manner.

## I'm a subscriber, how do I use the in-browser Kali Machine?
Subscribers have access to a [**Kali machine**](https://tryhackme.com/my-machine) hosted in the cloud for your convenience. Bring hacking to your browser, wherever you are, no setup required!


## The "Access" Page:

The access page is the reference point for anything VPN related.  Hopefully you will only have to visit this once to download your TryHackMe configuration file for OpenVPN! However, it is the first port of call in troubleshooting and resolving connectivity issues.

### Choosing VPN Server:
TryHackMe has multiple VPN servers placed throughout various geographic regions to help keep your ping low and connection stable. At the time of writing, TryHackMe has the following:

| Server Name  | Region  |
|---|---|
| EU-Regular-1  | Europe  |
| EU-Regular-2  | Europe  |
| EU-VIP-1  | Europe  |
| US-West-Regular-1  | United States - West Coast  |
| US-East-Regular-1  | United States - East Coast  |
| AU-Regular-1  | Australia  |

At times there may be lots of concurrent users on the site which is why some regions such as EU have two regular servers for load balancing.

## Verifying Connectivity:

Upon successful connection, OpenVPN will produce a message such as the one below:
```
DAY MONTH DATE HH:MM:SS YYYY Initialization Sequence Completed
```

If you have any doubts as to whether or not you are connected, deploy <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/openvpn">**[Task 6] Check you're connected**</a> in the OpenVPN room. After a few minutes, you will be able to visit the IP address of the instance assigned to you in your browser.

The IP address that you need to visit will be different to that within the screenshot above.

You should see the following in the browser of the device that you are connecting from. If so, you are connected! If not, refer to <a href="https://docs.tryhackme.com/docs/openvpn/troubleshooting/openvpn-troubleshooting">**the troubleshooting page**</a> for additional guidance.

### OpenVPN errors & Troubleshooting:
Configuration files have been known the generate with formatting issues. OpenVPN will fail with an error similar to the following if yours is faulty:
```
Mon Jun 15 22:28:35 2020 Cannot load inline certificate file
Mon Jun 15 22:28:35 2020 Exiting due to fatal error
```
To fix this, switch VPN servers and press "Regenerate". For example, if you were on **EU-Regular-1** then you should swap to **EU-Regular-2** and press "Regenerate" like below:

Please wait at least 10 seconds before pressing "Download My Configuration File". This will allow enough time for a new configuration file to be generated for you. After downloading, I suggest renaming and appending a `2` to the end to ensure you connect with this file in the future.
